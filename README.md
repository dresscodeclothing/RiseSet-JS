# RiseSet-JS

## Synopsis

This is a set of Javascript functions to compute sunrise, sunset, moonrise,
moonset.

## Explanation

There are a few such libraries already available but they didn't fit my 
needs (ie. not accurate, reasonably well documented or free to use) so I 
decided to write my own.

## Usage

Coming soon...
